My academic journey began in Salerno, Italy, where I completed my Bachelor’s degree. I then pursued a Master’s degree focused on Cloud Computing, which included an Erasmus experience in Sweden. Now, I’ve returned to Salerno for pursuing a PhD under the guidance of Biagio Cosenza <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8869-6705"><img alt="ORCID logo" src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" width="16" height="16"/></a>. 

I specialize in Graph Analytics on GPUs, exploring the synergy between heterogeneity and efficiency through the SYCL programming model. My research extends into frequency scaling on GPUs, aiming to push the boundaries of high-performance computing.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
